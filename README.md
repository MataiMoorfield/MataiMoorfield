### Hi there, I'm Matai 👋
I am currently a student at Hamilton Boys' High in Hamilton, New Zealand 🇳🇿. I'm passionate about web development 🌐, computer science 💻, and robotics 🤖. I'm currently working on various computer vision and deep learning projects, which I will be able to apply to an open-source quadrupedal robot.

Future university subjects I hope to take: 🎓

- Mechatronics 🛠
- Computer science/software engineering 💻
