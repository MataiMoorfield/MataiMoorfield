I am currently a student at Hamilton Boys' High in Hamilton, New Zealand 🇳🇿. I'm passionate about web development 🌐, computer science 💻, and robotics 🤖. I'm currently working on various computer vision and deep learning projects, which I will be able to apply to an open-source quadrupedal robot.

Future university subjects I hope to take: 🎓

- Mechatronics 🛠
- Computer science/software engineering 💻

- 🔩 I cane second in a bettleweight combat robot tournament and won a gaint nut as a trophy and a JBL Google Assistant speaker.

Future projecs:
- 🏎️ F1TENTH autonomous RC car racing
- ✈️ Carbon fiber RC plane with a DIY combustion jet
- 🐕 Open-source quadrupedal robot (for those who don't know, it's a robotic dog)
- 🤖 Autonomous robot which uses SLAM to map an enviroment with accurate measurements
